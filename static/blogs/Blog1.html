    <title>NEPAL AND INDIA BOTH TO BE BLAMED?</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>With Nepal formally changing the maps now, it seems unlikely that the dispute will be resolved anytime soon. In fact, the resolution of border disputes in South Asia occurs in very rare cases as no nation is willing to give away any of its territory. Nepal has now decided to deploy more military on its border with India. India must first agree that the region is disputed and Nepal must not take any steps that would escalate the conflict either. When the Kaliash Manasarovar Yatra begins, Nepal could effectively block the access of Indian pilgrims with its troops and this could result in a standoff between the two forces, although the possibility of something like this happening is low. It is better for India to not use the road for pilgrims until Nepal is taken into confidence. India cannot play the same card as China or Pakistan in such a case.</p>
